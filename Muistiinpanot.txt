The response variable is log of odds:

ln(odds)=ln(p/1-p)=a*x1 + b*x2 + ..+ z*xn

difference between null/ residual deviance
-> comparing the model to one that has only the intercept=null model
-> wider gap the better

significance of categorical predictor in logistic regression

- Usually, R excludes one level of the categorical and
the coefficients denote the difference of each class to this
reference class (or sometimes called baseline class) 

- to see the reference in R: options("contrasts")

- For each coefficient of every level of the categorical
variable, a Wald test is performed to test whether
the pairwise difference between the coefficient of
the reference class and the other class is different from
zero or not. This is what the z and p-values in 
the regression table are.

Cross-validation --> assessing generalization

-> binary: calculate the fraction of correctly classified obs
	& proportion of incorrectly= error/penalty/loss 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Odds ratios

-> the exp of the coeff.s can be interpret as ORs
between: unit change - no change
in the corresponding explanatory variable
