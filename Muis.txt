PCA

- to find most essential dimensions in the data
	(idea of dimensionality reduction in general)

- variance of the pca components will account for
	most of the variance of the data or variables in q.

- singular value decomposition (SVD) most important tool
	for dimension reduction
	
	-> PCA is a procedure using svd

- 1. PCA captures the max amount of variance
- 2. PCA captures max of variance left		and so on

- PCA's assumption: feature with a large variance is more
	important than one with a small variance

	--> standardization!!
	--> then comparison of features makes sense

- Biplot -> 1) observations
	 -> 2) features with their and pc's relationships
